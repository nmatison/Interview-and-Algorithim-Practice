# Graphs
Trees
+ basically created from graphs
+ can only flow in one direction
+ can only have one-way connections
+ can't have loops or cyclical links

Graphs
+ Have to have at least one single. **Singleton Graph** is a graph with only one node.
+ Directed graphs and Undirected Graphs
+ Edges (sometimes called links) can connect nodes in any way possible
+ **G = (V, E)** with v and e being sets
+ Facebook is an example of an undirected graph.
+ Twitter is an example of a directed graph.

Directed Edge
+ Two nodes connected in a specific way.
+ Starting node is called the origin and the one were travling to is called the destination.
+ Can only travel from the origin to the destination.
+ If all edges are directed then the graph is called a **digraph**

Undirected Edge
+ Path between two nodes is bidirectional(the origin and destination nodes are not fixed).
+ If all edges are undirected then the graph is referred to as a **undirected graph**.
