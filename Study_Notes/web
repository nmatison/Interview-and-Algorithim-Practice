## localStorage and sessionStorage
+ sessionStorage is only available for the duration of the browser session (deleted when the window or tab is closed). It does survive page reloads.
+ the data stored in both can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser.
+ Should not be used for storage of sensitive or security-related data

## Cookies
+ Cookies can have a degree of protection applied from security risks like Cross-Site Scripting/Script injection by setting an HTPP only flag which means modern browsers will prevent access to the cookies and values from js.
