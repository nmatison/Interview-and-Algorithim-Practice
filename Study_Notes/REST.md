# REST
### What is rest?
+ Stands for Representational State Transfer
+ Roy T. Fielding coined the term in 2000 in Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures
+ A generic set of principles not specific to the Web.
+ Not considered a protocol since it does not prescribe implementation details.
### The Fielding Constraints
Client-server:
+ The network must be made up of clients and servers
+ Client is a computer that sends HTTP requests to a server in order to access server resources
+ REST requires one-to-one communication as opposed to event-based integration which is where each component continuously broadcasts events while listening for events fro other components.
